# Module 5: Forms

## Exercises

### Exercise 2: Codingbat Over HTTP (with Forms!)

In this exercise you will create a project that completes a task similar to the original "Codingbat over HTTP" exercise, but this time you will implement use a template and process the user input with a Django Form (no path parameters!).

> For each of the paths bases below, implement the corresponding codingbat challenge as a view. I've created a [codingbat_over_http](./exercises/codingbat_over_http) directory for you to create your project/app in. Arguments should be collected from the path and the response should contain the answer to the challenge. Additionally, you should implement three of the test cases that coding bat provides as test cases in your django app.
>
> 1. [ ] `warmup-1/near-hundred/...` implemented with 3 test cases.
> 2. [ ] `warmup-2/string-splosion/...` implemented with 3 test cases.
> 3. [ ] `string-2/cat-dog/...` implemented with 3 test cases.
> 4. [ ] `logic-2/lone-sum/...` implemented with 3 test cases.
